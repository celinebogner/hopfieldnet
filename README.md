This project implements a classical Hopfield network, one of the earliest models of associative memory in computational neuroscience.  
The network stores binary or bipolar patterns and can recall them from noisy or partial input.

Currently includes:  
A core implementation of the Hebbian learning rule and recall algorithm  
A Python class interface (HopfieldNetwork) for modular use  
Support for binary-to-bipolar conversion and pattern normalization  

Planned updates:  
Interactive visualizer for network dynamics  
Higher-resolution pattern support  
A modern Hopfield network implementation for comparison
